# MUN Grading App

Created to help MUN chairs grade delegates on their speeches, diplomacy, and parlimentary procedure. Made for Berkeley Model United Nations, and as such follows the chairing guidelines set forth in this conference.

This application is made in React and has its data backed by a set of Google Sheets, configured by the application moderators.
