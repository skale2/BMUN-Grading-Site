Created to help MUN chairs grade delegates on their speeches, diplomacy, and parlimentary procedure. Made for [Berkeley Model United Nations](https://www.bmun.org), and as such follows the chairing guidelines set forth in this conference.

This application is made in React and has its data backed by a set of Google Sheets, configured by the application moderators.
